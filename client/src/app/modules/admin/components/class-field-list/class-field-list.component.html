<h2>
  Other Class Fields
</h2>
<p>
  Class Fields are custom fields that allow to associate data with class instances, that are not (directly) linked by
  dfh-properties. <br>
  Class fields are an extension to fields automatically generated for each property of the class. <br>
  Class fields are stored in the table commons.class_field. This table could be renamed to "class_fields".

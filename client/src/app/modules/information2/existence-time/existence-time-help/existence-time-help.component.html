  All events and phenomena have a certain duration. Geovistory provides different properties to narrow down this duration:

<img src="/assets/images/time-span.png" alt="Time Span Structure" class="img-fluid border mt-3 mb-5" style="max-width: 430px;">

<p>
  Please note that each calendar date has a certain duration. For example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>«1st of June 1981» has a duration of one day</li>
  <li>«1981» has a duration of one year</li>
</ul>

<p>Geovistory supports these levels of durations: years, months, days, hours, minutes and seconds.</p>

<p>These durations can be used to narrow down the duration of phenomena. This happens when you use «At some time within» and
  «Ongoing throughout».</p>


<h5 class="font-weight-bold">At some time within</h5>
<p>Use «At some time within», if the phenomenon happened at some time within the duration of the date you enter.</p>

<p>
  Example: The person was born at some time within the day 1st of June 1864.
</p>

<h5 class="font-weight-bold">Ongoing throughout</h5>
<p>Use «ongoing throughout» if the phenomenon was ongoing throughout the whole duration of the date you enter.</p>

<p>Example: The exercise of the consul's office was ongoing throughout the year 54 BC.</p>

<h5 class="font-weight-bold">Earliest possible begin</h5>
<p>«Earliest possible begin» specifies the earliest possible moment the phenomenon could have begun to exist.</p>

<p>Use this option, if the phenomenon may have existed during and after, but surely not before the date you enter.</p>


<h5 class="font-weight-bold">Begin</h5>
<p>«Begin» specifies the latest possible moment the phenomenon could have begun to exist.</p>

<p>Use this option, if the phenomenon surely existed after the date you enter.
  <br> If you are not sure wheter to use «Earliest possible begin» or «Begin», use «Begin».</p>

<h5 class="font-weight-bold">End</h5>
<p>«End» specifies the earliest possible moment the phenomenon could have ended to exist.</p>

<p>Use this option, if the phenomenon surely existed before this moment.
  <br> If you are not sure wheter to use «Latest possible end» or «End», use «End»</p>

<h5 class="font-weight-bold">Latest possible end</h5>
<p>«Latest possible end» specifies the latest possible moment the phenomenon could have ended to exist.</p>

<p>Use this option, if the phenomenon did surely not existing after the date you enter and may have existed before and during
  this date.</p>

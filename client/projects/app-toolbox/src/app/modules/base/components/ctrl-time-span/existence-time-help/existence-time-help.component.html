  All events and phenomena have a certain duration. Geovistory provides different properties to narrow down this
  duration:

  style="max-width: 430px;">

<p>
  Please note that each calendar date has a certain duration. For example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>«1st of June 1981» has a duration of one day</li>
  <li>«1981» has a duration of one year</li>
</ul>

<p>Geovistory supports different levels of durations: years, months, days, hours, minutes and seconds.</p>

<p>These durations can be used to narrow down the duration of phenomena. This happens when you use «At some time
  within» and
  «Ongoing throughout».</p>


<h5 class="font-weight-bold">At some time within</h5>
<p>Use «At some time within», if the phenomenon happened at some time within the duration of the date you enter.</p>

<p>
  Example: The person was born at some time within the day 1st of June 1864.
</p>

<h5 class="font-weight-bold">Ongoing throughout</h5>
<p>Use «ongoing throughout» if the phenomenon was ongoing throughout the whole duration of the date you enter.</p>

<p>Example: The exercise of the consul's office was ongoing throughout the year 54 BC.</p>

<h5 class="font-weight-bold">Begin (earliest possible)</h5>
<p>«Begin (earliest possible)» specifies the earliest possible moment the phenomenon could have begun to exist.</p>

<p>Use this option, if the phenomenon may have existed during and after, but surely not before the date you enter.</p>


<h5 class="font-weight-bold">Begin (latest possible)</h5>
<p>«Begin (latest possible)» specifies the latest possible moment the phenomenon could have begun to exist.</p>

<p>Use this option, if the phenomenon surely existed after the date you enter.
  <br> If you are not sure wheter to use «Begin (earliest possible)» or «Begin (latest possible)», use «Begin (latest
  possible)».
</p>

<h5 class="font-weight-bold">End (earliest possible)</h5>
<p>«End (earliest possible)» specifies the earliest possible moment the phenomenon could have ended to exist.</p>

<p>Use this option, if the phenomenon surely existed before this moment.
  <br> If you are not sure wheter to use «End (latest possible)» or «End (earliest possible)», use «End (earliest
  possible)»
</p>

<h5 class="font-weight-bold">End (latest possible)</h5>
<p>«End (latest possible)» specifies the latest possible moment the phenomenon could have ended to exist.</p>

<p>Use this option, if the phenomenon did surely not existing after the date you enter and may have existed before and
  during
  this date.</p>
